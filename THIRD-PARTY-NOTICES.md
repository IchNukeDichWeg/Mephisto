# Third-Party Notices

This project (a browser chess extension) redistributes the third-party software and neural-network
models listed below. Each is the property of its respective authors and is used under the license
shown. See [`LICENSING.md`](LICENSING.md) for how these licenses combine, and [`licenses/`](licenses/)
for the full GPL-3.0 and AGPL-3.0 texts.

For each entry: **Component — License — Copyright/authors — Source (corresponding source).**

## Base project

- **Mephisto (original)** — MIT — Copyright (c) 2022 Alexandru Petrusca —
  <https://github.com/AlexPetrusca/Mephisto>. This fork retains the original MIT license
  ([`LICENSE`](LICENSE)) for that code and this fork's own source changes.

## Chess engines (copyleft — GPL-3.0)

- **Stockfish** — used in the WebAssembly builds shipped under
  `lib/engine/stockfish-dev`, `stockfish-18`, `stockfish-18-small`, and `stockfish-11-hce` —
  **GPL-3.0-or-later** — Copyright (c) The Stockfish developers —
  <https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish>.
  The WebAssembly builds are produced by / obtained via the Lichess Stockfish-in-the-browser work
  (`@lichess-org/stockfish-web`, <https://github.com/lichess-org/stockfish.wasm> and related repos).
  Corresponding source: the Stockfish C++ source at the URL above, plus the WebAssembly build tooling
  from the Lichess repositories.

- **Fairy-Stockfish** — `lib/engine/fairy-stockfish-14` — **GPL-3.0-or-later** —
  Copyright (c) Fabian Fichter and the Fairy-Stockfish contributors —
  <https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish>. Corresponding source at that URL.

## Neural networks — engine evaluation (GPL-3.0)

- **Stockfish NNUE networks** — the `.nnue` files under `lib/engine/stockfish-*/` — **GPL-3.0** as
  distributed with Stockfish — © the Stockfish project — <https://tests.stockfishchess.org/nns> and
  <https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish>.

- **Fairy-Stockfish NNUE networks** (one per variant) — the `.nnue` files under
  `lib/engine/fairy-stockfish-14/nnue/` — **GPL-3.0** as distributed with Fairy-Stockfish —
  © the Fairy-Stockfish project — <https://github.com/fairy-stockfish/Fairy-Stockfish>.

## Neural networks — human-like play (Maia)

- **Maia (Maia-1) networks 1100–1900** — `lib/engine/maia/maia-1100.onnx … maia-1900.onnx` —
  **GPL-3.0** — Copyright (c) the Computational Social Science Lab (CSSLab), University of Toronto —
  <https://github.com/CSSLab/maia-chess>. Converted to ONNX from the upstream `.pb.gz` weights using
  `lc0 leela2onnx`; the original weights and training code are at that URL.

- **Maia 2200 network** — `lib/engine/maia/maia-2200.onnx` — **GPL-3.0** — © CallOn84 —
  <https://github.com/CallOn84/LeelaNets>. A Maia-architecture network extending the CSSLab rating
  range; converted to ONNX from the upstream `.pb.gz`.

- **Maia-3 model** — `lib/engine/maia3/maia3-23m.onnx` — **AGPL-3.0** — Copyright (c) the CSSLab,
  University of Toronto — <https://github.com/CSSLab/maia3> (weights also at
  <https://huggingface.co/UofTCSSLab>). Exported to ONNX from the upstream PyTorch model; the model
  code and weights are at those URLs.

## Code derived from Maia sources

- **Maia-3 input encoder / decoder** — `src/offscreen/maia3.js` — is a **derivative work of
  CSSLab/maia3** (its board tokenization, Elo conditioning, move vocabulary and output handling were
  reimplemented from that project's Python source) and is therefore distributed under **AGPL-3.0**.
  © the CSSLab (original) and this project's contributors (the JavaScript port) —
  <https://github.com/CSSLab/maia3>.

- **Maia-1 encoder / policy index** — `src/offscreen/maia.js` and
  `lib/engine/maia/lc0_policy_index.json` — implement the **Leela Chess Zero (lc0)** "classic" input
  planes and 1858-move policy ordering (the policy index was harvested from lc0's own output). These
  conventions originate with **Leela Chess Zero** (**GPL-3.0**) —
  <https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0>.
