// phase ends there is no move list at all. So read the pieces themselves.

//   * pieces are `.piece` carrying `data-piece` (PNBRQK) and `data-color`, 5 = White, 6 = Black.
//     The same two codes on both boards, so they are the two-player codes rather than a per-variant
//     thing. (They are NOT the 4PC seat codes 0=R/1=B/2=Y/3=G -- that lane stays separate.)
//   * position comes from `transform: translate(Xpx, Ypx)`, relative to `.TheBoard-squares`, whose
//     rect is IDENTICAL to `.TheBoard-layers` -- which is what getBoard() returns, so the existing
//     click geometry already lands on the right squares and autoplay needed no new code.
//   * THE PIECE BANK SHARES THE SAME CONTAINER as the board pieces and sits at NEGATIVE
//     coordinates. Nothing in the markup separates them, so being inside the board is the only
//     test there is -- read the bank as board pieces and every Setup Chess position is garbage.

// load: a click reported workerMs 1466 of which only 132ms was inside chrome.debugger, and 12
