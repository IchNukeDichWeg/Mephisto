// The endpoint (wss://analysis.chess.com/v2/game-review) speaks PROTOBUF, not JSON. The first message
// IS the game natively encoded: moves as from/to square pairs (a1=1 .. h8=64) with a promotion piece
// (n=1,b=2,r=3,q=4) and, for castling, the rook's own from/to; clocks in ms; players + Elo; the game
// id; the winner; and an option envelope. The encoder below reproduces a real captured hello
// BYTE-FOR-BYTE (pinned in the ladder), and the promotion/castling encodings were each mapped from
// their own captures, so it is trustworthy on any standard game. The response is decoded the same way.
//
// AUTH IS THE BROWSER'S OWN chess.com SESSION: the socket must go out with a native
// Origin: https://www.chess.com and the first-party session cookie, neither of which a service-worker
// socket can send (that is a 1008). So it runs in the MAIN world of a chess.com TAB via
// chrome.scripting.executeScript -- an already-open one, or one opened in the background and closed
// again. THE GAME LEAVES THIS MACHINE (that is the point): the PGN goes to chess.com, as on their
// own analysis page.
//
// THE STRENGTH TIER IS , an ordinal 1-4, MEASURED by capturing chess.com's own outgoing
// request at each setting of their own Strength select and diffing the four frames -- it was the
// only field that moved:
//     Fast (~1 sec, 3270)      select 18 -> 1
//     Standard (~5 sec, 3430)  select 22 -> 2
//     Deep (~20 sec, 3500)     select 24 -> 3
//     Maximum (~1m30, 3560)    select 26 -> 4
// Their select's own values are search DEPTHS (18/22/24/26); the seconds in the label are just how
// long that depth takes. f3 is NOT the tier: it is 10 in every capture including theirs, and six
// different values of it returned byte-identical reviews. This was hardcoded to 2 here, so every
// review we ever asked for came back at Standard whatever the dropdown said -- which the ladder's
// own 340-byte capture confirms from the other side: that frame, taken from their site, carries
// .2.3.1 = 2. Player UUIDs are omitted (a PGN has none).
