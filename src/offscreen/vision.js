// --- READING THE BOARD'S OWN COORDINATES --------------------------------------------------------
// The board usually says which way up it is, in the corner labels it draws itself, and that beats
// any inference from the pieces. Both major sites label the bottom row's corner squares -- lichess
// puts the rank digit on the RIGHT edge and the file letter bottom-left, chess.com the digit on the
// LEFT and the letter bottom-right -- so between the two bottom corner squares there is always a
// digit and a letter, wherever inside them they sit.
//
// This does NOT do OCR. It only needs to tell a handful of glyphs apart, and their TOPOLOGY does
// that without a model, a font, or a training set: counting enclosed holes,
//     1 -> 0     h -> 0     a -> 1     8 -> 2
// and two holes is unique to the 8. So "an 8 in either bottom corner" means Black is at the bottom,
// and an "a" tells you the same thing by WHICH corner it is in. Anything unreadable says nothing at
// all and the caller falls back to the pieces -- a wrong answer here is worse than no answer.
//
// MEASURED against real boards, both orientations: chess.com is decided here, correctly, both ways
// up. Lichess is NOT -- its bottom corners yielded no readable glyph one way up and fragments with
// no clean topology the other (a JPEG-scale 8 breaking into two open pieces), so it declines and
// the piece heuristic takes it, also correctly both ways. Declining is the designed outcome, not a
// gap to paper over: loosening this until lichess reads would be trading a right answer for a
// confident one.
